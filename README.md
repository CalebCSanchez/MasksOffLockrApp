TestingApp is the name we gave the app initially. You can run this on React Native by going to the file and running npm start.
From there you will need to download expo on iOS and scan the QR code to open the app.
Feel free to look through the code. Initially the map was suppose to have markers to determine where a "Lockr" is, however
React Native seems to not have a working marker system (Hence why theres a random map with really no purpose).
